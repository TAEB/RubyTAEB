To begin running TAEB on your own:

1. Create an account on nethack.alt.org. You can use an existing one but it's best to use a bot-specific account because of the next item in this list.
2. Set your rcfile to be the same as TAEB's. For convenience it's included in the distribution.
3. Modify the beginning of constants.rb to change the username from TAEB to your account name. You can also change the server but you do so at your own peril.
4. Modify password.txt in the top directory. Put your bot account's password into this file.
5. Run the script from the top directory with ./taeb.rb.
